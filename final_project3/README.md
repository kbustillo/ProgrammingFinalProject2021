#Convolution VS Panjer_recursion VS FFT

Hello ! And welcome to our project.

Our Project covers a lot of parts.

So if you want to analyze the execution time, you can chose between 2 options:

I) executing each one of the 5 codes (successively, and not at once because Nuvolos becomes too slow otherwise) relevant to the paper question (which is recommanded)

      cd final_project
      
      cd Discrete_case
      
      python DiscreteCasePoissonFormula.py
      
      python Discrete_npconvolve.py
      
      python discrete_FFT.py
      
      python Panjer_iterative.py 
      
      python Panjer_iterativeNumba.py
      
II) execute the final code which contains all the differents parts, but not with all the cases
    
      cd final_project
      
      cd Discrete_case
      
      python DiscreteFinal.py
